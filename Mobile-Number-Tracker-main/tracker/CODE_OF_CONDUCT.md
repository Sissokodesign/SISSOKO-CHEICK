## Our Pledge

We, the contributors and maintainers of the Phone Tracker CLI project, pledge to foster an open and welcoming community. We are committed to creating a respectful and inclusive environment for everyone, regardless of age, background, disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, level of experience, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that contribute to creating a positive environment include:

- **Respect**: Treat all individuals with respect and consideration, valuing diverse perspectives and experiences.

- **Inclusivity**: Welcome and support newcomers and encourage their participation.

- **Openness**: Embrace constructive criticism and be open to learning from others.

- **Collaboration**: Work together to resolve conflicts and create a collaborative and supportive community.

- **Empathy**: Be empathetic to the needs and feelings of others.

Examples of unacceptable behavior by participants include:

- **Harassment**: Use of offensive language or unwelcome sexual attention or advances.

- **Trolling**: Deliberate, repetitive, and unhelpful antagonistic behavior.

- **Derogatory Comments**: Negative comments or personal attacks based on attributes listed above.

- **Spam**: Unsolicited promotion of products or services.

## Our Responsibilities

Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying the standards of acceptable behavior and are expected to take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any instances of unacceptable behavior.

Project maintainers have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned with this Code of Conduct or to temporarily or permanently ban any contributor for other behaviors that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within the project space and when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces. This includes but is not limited to project repositories, GitHub discussions, social media, and events where project representatives are present.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the project maintainers by contacting them at [maintainer-email](mailto:maintainer-email). All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The project team is obligated to maintain confidentiality with regard to the reporter of an incident.
